    "## 1. Errors\n",
    "Python is a language, and like natural human languages, it has rules.  It differs from natural language in two important ways:\n",
    "1. The rules are *simple*.  You can learn most of them in a few weeks and gain reasonable proficiency with the language in a semester.\n",
    "2. The rules are *rigid*.  If you're proficient in a natural language, you can understand a non-proficient speaker, glossing over small mistakes.  A computer running Python code is not smart enough to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you write code, you'll make mistakes.  When you run a code cell that has errors, Python will sometimes produce error messages to tell you what you did wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors are okay; even experienced programmers make many errors.  When you make an error, you just have to find the source of the problem, fix it, and move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have made an error in the next cell.  Run it and see what happens."

If you see an asterisk (\\*) next to a cell that doesn't go away, it's likely that the code inside the cell is taking too long to run, and it might be a good time to interrupt the kernel (discussed below). When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: `In [1]`. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on. \n",

    "You may run into problems where your kernel is stuck for an excessive amount of time, your notebook is very slow and unresponsive, or your kernel loses its connection. If this happens, try the following steps:\n",
    "1. At the top of your screen, click **Kernel**, then **Interrupt**.\n",
    "2. If that doesn't help, click **Kernel**, then **Restart**. If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.\n",
    "3. If that doesn't help, restart your server. First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save and Checkpoint**. Next, click **Control Panel** at the top right. Choose **Stop My Server** to shut it down, then **Start My Server** to start it back up. Then, navigate back to the notebook you were working on. You'll still have to run your code cells again."
